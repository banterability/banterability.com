We're celebrating a birthday. In September, the first domain name I ever registered will be old enough to order a whiskey sour.

I've had a presence on the internet in some form or another for even longer, fiddling with tktktk

registered xstudios domain 2001

back in the good old days, when I, a pre-teen, registered a .com domain by just telling someone over the phone that I was good for the cash.

an incalculable amount of one-off - Homestead

- Tripod
  either rotting somewhere in the back corner of the Wayback Machine, or blissfully gone.

I registered this domain in November 2005

a folder on a shared host
a number of Wordpress instances, both hosted and otherwise
redirected to Tumblr / Medium
no fewer than five homegrown blog engines

my hobby
then my job
then my career

```diff-js
function() {
-  doSomething();
+  doSomethingElse();
   finishTheThing();
}
```
