After almost six years away from the Midwest, I’m dusting off my guides to awkward friendliness and dressing in layers.

<strong>At the end of this month, I’m moving to Chicago to join the team at Groupon as a Software Engineer.</strong>

There’s so much I’m eager to learn from their incredible front-end team as I build the interfaces that Groupon’s millions of customers use to discover their cities every day.

And there aren’t even words to describe how excited I am to be closer to <a href="http://sandboxdiaries.tumblr.com">this one</a> after two very patient years of frequent flier miles and cell phone overage charges.

Today is my last day at <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.scpr.org/">KPCC</a>. During my time as a developer here, I’ve had the opportunity to design and build a whole new web presence from the ground up, as well as delivering code on deadline for stories on prison abuse, city budgets, teacher evaluation, and elections. It’s such an exciting time for both the newsroom here and local journalism in general. Without being too gushy, these folks are true professionals and they’re pioneering new ways of telling stories on-air and online. Even when I’m 2,000 miles away, you’d better believe I’ll still be a member.

Much more to come as I start packing up my life here in Los Angeles and set out on this new adventure. Watch this space.
