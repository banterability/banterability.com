One of the toughest things about being a “computer person” is that business and pleasure have a bad habit of intertwining. As much as I love exploring Tumblr and Twitter and Vimeo, every second I’m online is a second I could be doing development work.

I have the same dilemma with being a college student. With a regular job, you’re on duty during office hours, then the rest of the day belongs to you. But as a student, you live at school. All your work, be it semester-long projects or essays or busywork assignments or studying for an exam, could be done at any time, meaning even when you’re sitting on the couch watching “King of the Hill,” you could (and probably should) be working. Your mind and its little chorus of alarm bells never have a reason to shut off.

That’s why I’ve fallen in love with taking short mental vacations – basically doing whatever it takes to make it impossible to do work. Sometimes that means leaving my laptop and my phone behind and going for a walk on the beach. Other times (like this weekend) it means hopping on a plane and jetting across the country – anything to get out of the same old mental space, out of the apartment and out of communications range.

The delightful Jack Cheng talks about it as “<a href="https://href.li/?http://www.jackcheng.com/in-praise-of-lo-fi">lo-fi time</a>,” and in a great article explains how sometimes the best defense against distraction is just blocading all the doors and windows against the introduction of any new data:</p><blockquote><div>…while we might not be able to change our minds’ ability to deal with an overwhelming amount of information, we can do things to force ourselves into environments and situations better suited for reflection.</div></blockquote><p>As I’ve <a href="http://1x7.tumblr.com/post/69735198/office-hours">alluded to previously</a>, it’s getting harder and harder to convince other people that I shouldn’t be reachable at any point in time and I still get the angry “I emailed you <em>two whole hours ago</em>; where have you been?!” messages, but it’s increasingly clear to me that leaving myself open to any type of interruption at any time is a recipe for chaos and disapointment.

For the doubters, the hidden benefit I’ve found in taking these mini hiatuses is the passion and enthusiasm I have available for everyday tasks when I check back in. With my thoughts and priorities arranged everything seems like so much less of a fire. Paradoxicaly, making yourself less available (as Merlin Mann puts it, <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.slideshare.net/merlinmann/living-with-data-attention-sinks-time-burglars">making your attention less of a bargain</a>) seems to be one of the best ways to make sure you’re directing your time and energy towards the people and things you care about.
