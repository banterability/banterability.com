I've had a presence on the internet in some form or another for over 20 years

back in the good old days, where I, a pre-teen, bought a domain by just telling someone I was good for the cash

I've never been quiet for

Nothing is worse than the post about how you are going to start posting, so let's try a different tack:

/dealing with being bad before you get good/

warnings of using a blank `<textarea>` as a therapist
but I have one of those too, so no risk there.

> Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had told this to me.

> All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But it's like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good. It’s not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not that good.

> But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They quit.
>
> Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that.
>
> And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you're going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions.

At the risk of invoking Twitter's favorite strawman, the "gifted" child, this speaks to me:

> ASYNCHRONOUS DEVELOPMENT: It is useful to listen for pangs of frustration that accompanied asynchronous development (Columbus Group, 1991) wherein the gifted child could envision what she or he wanted to create—e.g., a song on the piano, a three-dimensional drawing, an invention—long before the skills were in place to produce it.
>
> Gifted adults remember feeling like failures because of the lag time between idea and competence. Their growth patterns are often laced with a deep sense of defeat because of this gap, especially if it was never explained to them.
>
> For many it was profoundly frustrating when their imaginations seemed to be light years ahead of their developing hands and linguistic expertise (Kerr, 1991; Silverman, 1991; Tolan, 1994; Webb & Kleine, 1993).
