- A laser printer with AirPrint support occasionally prints pages full of garbage characters until the tray is empty instead of a document.
- Two identical WeMo switches purchased and set up on the same day. One always works with Alexa, rarely with HomeKit, the other the opposite.
- Playing music from Spotify via the Sonos app always works. Playing music to a Sonos speaker from the Spotify app works one out of five times.
